# Ketch — Architecture

Fast, stateless CLI for agentic web search and scrape.

## Module Layout

```
main.go                      Thin entry point → cmd.Execute()
cmd/
  root.go                    Cobra root, global flag (--json)
  search.go                  Search command: query → results, optional --scrape
  scrape.go                  Scrape command: URLs → markdown, concurrent batch
  extract.go                 Extract command: piped HTML → markdown (no fetch/cache/browser)
  crawl.go                   Crawl command: BFS/sitemap crawl with streaming output
  crawl_bg.go                Background crawl: status, stop subcommands, worker mode
  code.go                    Code search command: query → snippet results, --lang qualifier
  docs.go                    Docs search command: query → docs/snippet results, --library, --resolve
  config.go                  Config command: discovery, init, set, path
  cache.go                   Cache command: stats, clear
  browser.go                 Browser command: install, status
  doctor.go                  Doctor command: report formatting + exit-code gating over doctor.Run
  mcp.go                     MCP command: `mcp serve` runs the MCP server over stdio
  proc_unix.go               Unix process management (detach, signals)
  proc_windows.go            Windows process management stub
search/                      Searcher interface + Brave/DDG/SearXNG/EXA/Firecrawl/Keenable/Tavily/Parallel/SerpBase backends; NewFromConfig resolves the ordered provider registry for cmd/ and mcp/. multi.go adds federated --multi search (RRF fusion, NewMultiFromConfig), canonical.go the URL dedup keys
code/                        code.Searcher interface + GrepApp/Sourcegraph/GitHub backends; NewFromConfig resolves the ordered provider registry
docs/                        docs.Searcher interface + Context7 backend (FTS5 local is an unimplemented stub); NewFromConfig resolves the ordered provider registry
mcp/                         MCP server (search/code/docs/scrape/crawl tools; the mcp_tools config key is an allowlist over the published set) over the go-sdk mcp package; Server struct holds the shared scraper + cache, tools call the same NewFromConfig constructors as the CLI
scrape/                      HTTP fetch + Page type, JS detection fallback, Rod browser; pipeline.go has the cache-aware scrape pipeline (CachedScrape*, ScrapeSelector, FetchLLMSTxt) shared by cmd/ and mcp/
extract/                     readability + html-to-markdown pipeline, JS shell detection (Detector: built-in + config spa_markers, modern hydration/streaming frameworks)
crawl/                       BFS crawler, work queue + worker pool, background status
cookies/                     Netscape cookies.txt jar loader + RFC 6265 domain/path matching (Jar.For); nil-safe, values never logged
config/                      JSON config loading/saving (~/.config/ketch/)
doctor/                      Health checks: concurrent read-only probes per backend + browser + cache, status classification (ok/no_key/unreachable/misconfigured/skipped)
cache/                       TTL page cache (Store interface, BBoltStore backend)
httpx/                       Shared tuned *http.Transport for all HTTP backends
updatecheck/                 "new release available" probe + throttled stderr hint
site/                        VitePress documentation site (deployed to gh-pages)
```

Reusable packages live at the module root so external programs can `import "github.com/1broseidon/ketch/<pkg>"`. Nothing is module-private right now — if something becomes CLI-only, move it under `internal/`.

## Design Principles

- **Stateless**: no daemon, no queue. Call → result → done. Background crawls are detached processes, not a server.
- **Fast path first**: plain HTTP fetch; browser rendering kicks in automatically when JS shell is detected.
- **Interface-driven backends**: `Searcher` for search engines, `Store` for cache backends, `BrowserConn` for browser rendering.
- **Concurrent by default**: multiple URLs scraped in parallel via goroutines.
- **Operator configures, agent consumes**: config sets defaults (backend, browser, cache TTL) so agents don't need to know infrastructure.
- **Three search surfaces**: `ketch search` finds web pages, `ketch code` greps real OSS code, `ketch docs` fetches library documentation. Each has its own backend interface and Result type — they never share backends.
- **Smart input detection on scrape**: single URL, multiple positional args, JSON array string, file path, or stdin pipe all work — ketch routes automatically. No --batch flag needed.
- **Context-aware interfaces**: all three Searcher interfaces (`search`, `code`, `docs`) take `context.Context` as first param for cancellation and timeout propagation.

The reasoning behind each principle — and what ketch deliberately does *not* do — is in [design/DESIGN.md](design/DESIGN.md) ([Non-Goals & Scope](design/DESIGN.md#non-goals--scope)). Possible directions: [design/ROADMAP.md](design/ROADMAP.md). Decisions already made: [design/adr/](design/adr/).

## MCP Server

`ketch mcp serve` runs an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server over stdio, exposing five tools: `search`, `code`, `docs`, `scrape`, and `crawl`. The `mcp_tools` config key is an allowlist over that set (JSON array or comma-separated; unset or `[]` publishes all five) — unlisted tools are never registered, and `serverInstructions` is generated from the enabled set so a pruned server never advertises what it won't answer. Values are validated fail-loud at `config set`, on the `KETCH_MCP_TOOLS` env override, and at server startup. Tool handlers call the same packages as the Cobra commands, through the same config-driven constructors (`search.NewFromConfig` etc.), and resolve backends/API keys from the same `~/.config/ketch/` config — an agent talking MCP sees exactly what a human using the CLI sees.

- **Lifecycle**: the go-sdk dispatches tool calls concurrently, so process-lifetime resources — the headless-browser scraper, the bbolt page-cache handle, the compiled URL rewriter — are constructed once in `mcp.NewServer`, shared by all calls, and released by `Server.Close` when `serve` exits. Never construct these per call.
- **Option parity**: each tool exposes the per-invocation options of its CLI command (`scrape` gets `selector`/`raw`/`force_browser`/`no_llms_txt`/`trim`/`max_chars`/`no_cache` plus a `urls` batch input; `search` gets `searxng_url`, `scrape`, and `multi` (federated RRF search, with an additive `errors` map for per-backend failures); `crawl` gets `depth`/`sitemap`/`allow`/`deny`/`max_pages`). Config-level settings (API keys, cache TTL, browser binary) stay operator-configured and are never tool params.
- **Error taxonomy**: every tool error starts with a stable machine-readable prefix mirroring the CLI exit codes — `[validation]` (exit 2), `[not_found]` (3), `[upstream]` (4), `[precondition]` (5), `[cancelled]` (6) — so agents can tell "fix your input" from "retry later". MCP has no structured tool-error field; the prefix is the contract.
- **Bounded crawl**: the `crawl` tool is synchronous and capped (`max_pages` default 30, hard cap 100, 3-minute wall clock); partial results return with `stopped: "max_pages" | "timeout"`. Detached background crawls (`ketch crawl --background`, status/stop) remain CLI-only.
- **CLI-only operator commands**: `config`, `cache`, and `doctor` are deliberately not MCP tools. They are operator actions (change credentials, clear state, diagnose the installation), not research surfaces — an agent that needs to know whether a backend is ready reads `ketch config`'s `*_set` booleans or the operator runs `ketch doctor`. Don't add them to the server.
- **Annotations**: all tools are read-only network fetchers and declare `readOnlyHint: true` and `openWorldHint: true`.
- **Security note**: the server performs no URL filtering — `scrape` and `crawl` fetch whatever URL the client supplies, including private or internal addresses reachable from wherever the server runs (their descriptions say so). Run it with the network posture you'd give the agent itself; don't point an untrusted agent at a server inside a sensitive network.
- **Smoke test**: `go test -tags mcpsmoke ./mcp/... -v` exercises the real binary over stdio (live network; not part of `go test ./...`).

## Quality Standards

- `golangci-lint run` must pass (gocyclo max 15)
- `go test ./...` must pass
- Pre-commit hook enforces both
- CGO_ENABLED=0 — pure Go, cross-compile everywhere

## Adding a provider

Add the implementation, descriptor, and health probe in one Go file under `search/`, `code/`, or `docs/`, plus its tests. Add one descriptor call to that package's ordered `providers` slice in `registry.go`. Config keys, environment overrides, redacted discovery, doctor, CLI backend lists, MCP descriptions, and search multi/random eligibility then follow the descriptor. Do not add provider switches to consumers or register through `init()`.

- Define `ID`, `Name`, `Settings`, `Usable`, `New`, and `Probe`. `Usable` checks configuration without network I/O; `Build` applies it before `New`. Factories only construct clients and must also accept empty credentials; they never probe or validate credentials themselves.
- Import `internal/configbase` as `config` inside provider packages to avoid the public config facade's dependency on all three registries. The public `config.Config` is an alias for the same model. Read settings with `String`/`Strings`, and use `SetProvider` for overrides so shared MCP config is not mutated.
- Use `config.KeyPool("example_api_key", "example_api_keys")` for rotating credentials, or a `config.Setting` for a scalar URL or token. Provider settings own defaults, secret handling, and optional token resolution. Existing order numbers preserve legacy JSON and environment presentation; new key pools need no order numbers.
- Doctor checks every provider. Selection or explicitly configured credentials make a failed check required; this differs from usability (a selected provider with a missing key must still fail doctor). `GateDoctor` marks settings that trigger this requirement. Search providers may declare `MinProbeTimeout` for slow self-hosted probes.
- Code providers declare regex support in their descriptor. Docs providers may implement `docs.LibraryResolver` for library resolution and direct lookup; consumers assert the interface, with no capability bitflags. Keep the unimplemented local docs provider hidden.
- Test requests, result mapping, authentication, cancellation, and relevant error/retry behavior. Run `make lint` and `make test`; config and doctor golden fixtures must stay unchanged for a refactor, and a new provider may only add its own keys and doctor row to them (`UPDATE_REGISTRY_GOLDENS=1 go test ./cmd/ ./doctor/`). The cross-package completion test in `search/registry_test.go` demonstrates one registration flowing through every consumer.

The existing provider-specific config accessors remain compatibility helpers; adding a provider does not require adding another accessor. Static documentation (README and site backend tables) is updated in the same PR when a provider is admitted, but it is not executable registration. Admission criteria live in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
