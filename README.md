A stateless CLI for web search, code search, library docs, and scraping — one binary, no daemon, no API server to run.

## Why ketch

Most research tooling for agents means wiring up several provider SDKs, each with its own auth and response shape. ketch collapses that into one binary with three research surfaces:

- `ketch search` — web search (Brave, DuckDuckGo, SearXNG, Exa, Firecrawl, Keenable, Tavily, Parallel, or SerpBase)
- `ketch code` — grep real OSS source across public repos (Grep, Sourcegraph, or GitHub Code Search)
- `ketch docs` — library documentation (Context7 or Read the Docs)

Plus `ketch scrape` and `ketch crawl` to turn HTML pages and text-based PDFs into clean markdown.

It's built for two audiences at once:

- **Humans**, who want a fast terminal tool for the same job `curl | pandoc` or a browser tab would otherwise do.
- **AI agents**, who want structured, predictable output (`--json` everywhere), documented exit codes for control flow, and a single `ketch config` call to discover what backends are active — no environment probing, no per-provider glue code.

An operator configures the backend once (`ketch config set backend searxng`); every agent invocation afterward just calls `ketch search` or `ketch scrape` without knowing or caring which provider is behind it.

## Install

```sh
# Homebrew
brew install 1broseidon/tap/ketch

# go install
go install github.com/1broseidon/ketch@latest

# Or download a prebuilt binary (linux/darwin/windows, amd64/arm64)
# from https://github.com/1broseidon/ketch/releases
```

## Introduction

Go is an open-source programming language that focuses on simplicity, reliability, and efficiency...
```

Search real OSS code with zero configuration:

```sh
$ ketch code "http.NewRequestWithContext" --lang go --limit 2
---
query: http.NewRequestWithContext
lang: go
backend: grepapp
result_count: 2
---
harness/harness  registry/app/remote/clients/registry/client.go  (line 207)
  req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodGet, buildPingURL(c.url), nil)
  https://github.com/harness/harness/blob/main/registry/app/remote/clients/registry/client.go
...
```

Web search needs a backend configured first — the default (`brave`) requires a free API key:

```sh
ketch config set brave_api_key <key>
ketch search "golang error handling"
ketch search "golang error handling" --scrape   # fetch + extract full content per result
ketch search "golang error handling" --multi    # federate across every usable backend, rank-fused
ketch search "golang error handling" --random  # pick one random backend, fallback to rest on failure
```

`--multi` queries several backends at once and fuses their rankings with
Reciprocal Rank Fusion (a page several engines rank highly floats to the top),
deduplicating by URL and tagging each result with the engines that returned it.
`--random` shuffles the backend list, tries one, and falls back to the rest —
ideal when you want one provider's results without wasting rate limits on all
of them. Both support bare (all usable backends) or `=brave,exa` explicit lists, and both
are mutually exclusive with `--backend` and each other.
See [`site/reference/commands.md`](./site/reference/commands.md).

Every command takes `--json` for structured output:

```sh
ketch scrape https://example.com --json
# {"url":"https://example.com","title":"Example Domain","markdown":"..."}
```

Pipe any HTML through ketch's readability + markdown pipeline without a fetch:

```sh
curl -L https://chain.sh/ketch | ketch extract
cat page.html | ketch extract --select article --max-chars 4000
```

### PDF extraction

`ketch scrape` detects PDFs from the response MIME type or `%PDF-` signature and extracts their text with a built-in pure-Go parser:

```sh
ketch scrape https://example.com/report.pdf
```

Scanned/image-only PDFs need OCR and return a precondition error with an OCR-converter hint in the built-in path. Operators can configure an external PDF-to-Markdown converter that writes Markdown to stdout (capped at 10 MiB); its shlex-parsed command must contain exactly one `{input}` placeholder:

```sh
ketch config set external_pdf_to_md_converter_command 'pdftotext "{input}" -'
ketch config set external_pdf_to_md_converter_timeout_sec 300
```

When configured, the external converter is authoritative: failures are returned rather than silently falling back to the built-in parser. PDF binary output is never emitted: `--raw` and `--select` reject PDFs as validation errors. With `--force-browser`, PDF markdown still uses text extraction and never opens Chromium's PDF viewer.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `search` | Web search — Brave, DuckDuckGo, SearXNG, Exa, Firecrawl, Keenable, Tavily, Parallel, or SerpBase |
| `code` | Grep real OSS source — Grep (default), Sourcegraph, or GitHub Code Search |
| `docs` | Library/framework docs — Context7 (curated, version-aware snippets) or Read the Docs (section-level search of hosted project docs) |
| `scrape` | Fetch HTML or PDF URL(s) and extract clean markdown; concurrent batch, JSON array, file, or stdin input |
| `extract` | Convert piped HTML to clean markdown (`curl ... \| ketch extract`) — no fetch, no cache, no browser |
| `crawl` | BFS or sitemap crawl with optional background execution and status tracking |
| `browser` | Manage headless Chrome for JS-rendered pages (`install`, `status`) |
| `config` | Show effective config as JSON, or `init` / `set` / `path` |
| `cache` | Show page-cache stats, or `clear` |
| `doctor` | Live health check of every backend, the browser, and the cache — exit `0` healthy, `5` when a configured surface is broken |
| `mcp` | Run ketch as an MCP server over stdio (`mcp serve`) — the five research surfaces as tools |
| `version` | Print version, commit, build date |

Every command supports `-h/--help` for its full flag list; `--json` is the only flag global to every command. Full flag reference lives at [1broseidon.github.io/ketch](https://1broseidon.github.io/ketch/).

### Backends

| Surface | Default | Also available | Setup |
|---|---|---|---|
| `search` | `brave` | `ddg`, `searxng`, `exa`, `firecrawl`, `keenable`, `tavily`, `parallel`, `serpbase`, `degoog` | Brave, Firecrawl, Tavily, and SerpBase need a free key (`ketch config set brave_api_key <key>` / `firecrawl_api_key` / `tavily_api_key` / `serpbase_api_key`); `ddg`, `searxng`, `exa`, `keenable`, and `parallel` work with zero config; `degoog` needs a self-hosted instance (`ketch config set degoog_url <url>`) |
| `code` | `grepapp` | `sourcegraph`, `github` | Grep and Sourcegraph need nothing; GitHub uses `gh auth login`, `$GITHUB_TOKEN`, or `ketch config set github_token <tok>` |
| `docs` | `context7` | `readthedocs`, `local` (planned, not yet implemented) | Context7 needs a free key (`ketch config set context7_api_key <key>`); Read the Docs works with zero config, scoped to a project (`--library <slug>`) |

## Why it works well for agents

- **Stateless, single binary.** No daemon, no server to keep alive — call, get a result, exit.
- **Documented exit codes**, not just stderr text, for scripted control flow: `2` bad input, `3` not found, `4` upstream/network failure, `5` missing precondition (e.g. no API key), `6` cancelled (SIGINT/SIGTERM).
- **Automatic JS-rendering fallback.** `ketch scrape` and `ketch crawl` detect JS-shell pages (React/Vue/Svelte SPAs, streaming hydration frameworks) and transparently re-fetch via headless Chrome when needed — same output shape either way.
- **Smart input detection on `scrape`.** Single URL, multiple positional args, a JSON array, a file of URLs, or stdin — no `--batch` flag required.
- **Page cache.** Fetches are cached (bbolt, default TTL 72h); repeat scrapes and crawls return instantly. `--no-cache` bypasses it.
- **One discovery call.** `ketch config` returns the full effective configuration and active backends as JSON, so an agent can inspect capabilities without parsing `--help` text.

## Configuration

ketch reads defaults from `~/.config/ketch/config.json`. Flags always override config values.

```sh
ketch config init                          # write a default config file
ketch config set backend searxng           # set a default backend
ketch config set searxng_url http://my-searxng:8080
ketch config set browser chrome            # enable browser fallback for JS-rendered pages
ketch config                               # print effective config + available backends
ketch config path                          # print the config file path
```

### Environment variables

Every scalar config key can also be set through the environment as `KETCH_` + the upper-snake key name — handy for containers and CI where writing a config file is awkward:

```sh
KETCH_BRAVE_API_KEY=<key> ketch search "query"     # keys/tokens without touching disk
KETCH_BACKEND=ddg KETCH_LIMIT=10 ketch search "query"
KETCH_CONFIG=/etc/ketch/config.json ketch config    # point at an alternate config file
```

Precedence is **CLI flag > `KETCH_*` env > config file > built-in default**. Notes:

- Per-provider key vars (`KETCH_BRAVE_API_KEY`, `KETCH_EXA_API_KEY`, `KETCH_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`, `KETCH_KEENABLE_API_KEY`) accept a comma-separated list and replace the provider's whole key pool (there are no `*_API_KEYS` plural vars).
- `KETCH_GITHUB_TOKEN` beats the config file, which beats an ambient `$GITHUB_TOKEN`/`$GH_TOKEN`.
- `url_rewrites` and `spa_markers` are file-only (their JSON/regex values don't survive env quoting).
- `ketch config` (show) reports an `env_overrides` section, so you can always see which effective values came from the environment; `ketch config set` writes only file values and never persists env-derived ones.
- Invalid env values (e.g. `KETCH_LIMIT=abc`) fail loudly on commands that use config, naming the offending variable; `ketch version` and `ketch config set/path` still work.
- Secret `KETCH_*` vars are stripped from the environment of spawned subprocesses (headless browser, external PDF converter).

Other configurable keys include per-backend API keys (`brave_api_key`, `brave_api_keys` for multi-key rotation, `exa_api_key`, `firecrawl_api_key`, `keenable_api_key`, `tavily_api_key`, `serpbase_api_key`, `context7_api_key`, `github_token`), `firecrawl_url` / `sourcegraph_url` / `degoog_url` / `readthedocs_url` (self-hosted overrides), `cache_ttl`, `url_rewrites` (regex rewrite rules applied before fetch), `spa_markers` (extra JS-shell detection tokens), `cookie_file` (see below), and the optional external PDF converter command/timeout. Multiple keys per provider are picked randomly per request to spread rate limits. See the [config reference](https://1broseidon.github.io/ketch/) for the full list.

### Cookies (BYO cookies.txt)

Some pages only render their real content once a session or consent cookie is present — a logged-in dashboard, or a consent-banner wall (e.g. Nvidia NGC docs) that shows only the banner to an anonymous headless browser. ketch can attach your own cookies to every fetch, on both the HTTP and browser paths.

Supply a jar in the **Netscape `cookies.txt` format** — the same format exported by browser "cookies.txt" extensions and consumed by `curl` and `yt-dlp`:

```sh
ketch scrape https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/... --cookie-file ~/cookies.txt
ketch search "query" --scrape --cookie-file ~/cookies.txt
ketch crawl https://internal.example.com --cookie-file ~/cookies.txt
ketch config set cookie_file ~/cookies.txt          # persist as a default
```

- The `--cookie-file` flag overrides the `cookie_file` config value; an explicit empty flag (`--cookie-file ""`) disables cookies for that run.
- Only cookies whose Domain, HostOnly, Path, and Secure scope matches the request URL are sent; scope is re-evaluated on every redirect, and expired entries are rechecked before every request.
- Cookie **values are never printed** — not in output frontmatter, `--json`, errors, or `ketch doctor`. `ketch doctor` reports `configured (N cookies, M expired)` and nothing more. Keep the jar at `chmod 600`; ketch warns on stderr if it is group/world-readable.
- A configured jar uses a jar-specific page-cache namespace, including before redirects, so authenticated content cannot collide with anonymous cached copies. Authenticated content is still cached locally: on POSIX, ketch protects the cache directory/database as `0700`/`0600`; use `--no-cache` if it must not be stored.

**Responsibility:** respecting a site's Terms of Service and using only your own session cookies is entirely the operator's responsibility.

## Agent integration

Point an agent's system prompt at ketch instead of teaching it individual search/scrape APIs:

```markdown
Use `ketch` for external research — web pages, OSS code, library docs.
- `ketch search "query"` / `ketch search "query" --scrape` for web results with optional full content (add `--multi` to federate across backends and rank-fuse)
- `ketch scrape <url> [url...]` for clean markdown from one or more URLs
- `ketch extract` for already-fetched/piped HTML (`curl ... | ketch extract`) — no fetch, no cache, no browser
- `ketch code "query" --lang go` for real OSS code with repo/line context
- `ketch docs "query" --library /org/repo` for version-aware library docs
- All commands support `--json`. `ketch config` reports active backends.
```

The operator configures backends once; the agent's prompt never needs to mention which provider is behind `ketch search`.

For a fuller agent playbook — surface routing, token budgets, error-code control flow, a deep-research recipe, and guided backend setup — install the bundled skill from [`skills/ketch/`](./skills/ketch/) (works with any agent that loads `SKILL.md`-style skills, e.g. Claude Code).

### MCP server

For agents that speak MCP instead of shelling out, `ketch mcp serve` runs the same five surfaces — `search`, `code`, `docs`, `scrape`, `crawl` — as MCP tools over stdio, using the same config and backends as the CLI. To register it with Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add ketch -- ketch mcp serve
```

Tool errors carry the exit-code taxonomy as stable message prefixes: `[validation]`, `[not_found]`, `[upstream]`, `[precondition]`, `[cancelled]`.

### Claude Code plugin

The CLI on PATH is all ketch needs — but if you want Claude Code to wire up the MCP server and the [bundled skill](./skills/ketch/) in one step, this repo doubles as a plugin marketplace:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add 1broseidon/ketch
claude plugin install ketch@ketch
```

The plugin registers `ketch mcp serve` as an MCP server and installs the ketch research skill. It does not bundle the binary: `ketch` >= v0.10.0 must be on PATH (`brew install 1broseidon/tap/ketch` or `go install github.com/1broseidon/ketch@latest`).
